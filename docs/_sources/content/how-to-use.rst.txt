How to use
++++++++++

The schema below reveals the general structure of the :ref:`pyvalid` package:

  :width: 600

The package consists of two decorators: :ref:`accepts<pyvalid.accepts>` and :ref:`returns<pyvalid.returns>`, which
validates the functionâ€™s input and output values accordingly. To know how to
validate the data, :ref:`accepts<pyvalid.accepts>` and :ref:`returns<pyvalid.returns>` decorators should receive the
information about excepted values/types/validators.

The very basic example below shows how to use :ref:`accepts<pyvalid.accepts>` and :ref:`returns<pyvalid.returns>`
decorators.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyvalid import accepts, returns


    @accepts(int, int)
    @returns(float)
    def divide(num_1, num_2):
        return num_1 / num_2

    divide(8, 42)
    # Returns float value

    divide('Python', 42)
    # Raises the ArgumentValidationError exception, since the 1st argument is
    # the str value, when we're expecting int values only.

If just specifying an expected type or value is not enough, then it's worth to
use the custom validator. All the built-in validators are located in the
:ref:`pyvalid.validators` module and it's also possible to create a new one using
the ``is_validator`` decorator or through extending the ``AbstractValidator``
class.

We can flexibly control the state of the :ref:`pyvalid` validation using the 
:ref:`pyvalid.switch` module. This module provides an ability to switch the
:ref:`pyvalid` on/off.

In most cases, it's worth to use the :ref:`pyvalid` features to validate
incoming/outcoming data, such as: user input, the data sent to the API, etc.

But it's also possible to use the :ref:`pyvalid` package as a part of the CI/CD
processes only:

#. Apply the :ref:`accepts<pyvalid.accepts>` and :ref:`returns<pyvalid.returns>` decorators to all needed functions
   and methods.
#. Perform unit testing, integration testing, etc.
#. The :ref:`accepts<pyvalid.accepts>` and :ref:`returns<pyvalid.returns>` decorators will raise exceptions in case if
   the input/output data is not valid.
#. Collect information about raised exceptions and fix the code, which causes
   them.
#. Turn off the :ref:`pyvalid` before going live in order to avoid unnecessary
   exceptions in production.
